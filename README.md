# Introduction

This repository holds my configuration files so that I can clone them to other machines
easily.


## Installation

    git clone git://github.com/mhn-ksu/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

## Setup

The `install.sh` script will setup the dotfiles I use on most machines. It asks about each tool,
defaulting to yes for those I typically use, and no for those I no longer use, or use as much.

    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ./install.sh
