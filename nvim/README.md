# Neovim Configuration

## Background
I've been using some form of Vi/Vim/Neovim since 1997. Around 2008, when I started using Octopress
for my website, I started customizing my Vim setup. The oldest commit in my dotfiles repository that
mentions Vim is from November 14, 2011. The initial Neovim commit is from December 17, 2015. For a
while I maintained both a Vim and a Neovim configuration, but over time the Vim configuration
became stale as it was no longer being maintained.

Beginning in late 2021 I began converting my Neovim configuration to use Lua. A
number of resources helped me in that endeavor, they are listed in the appendix below.

## Prerequisites

* Neovim 0.8.*x or later
* Node - Several of the language servers I have setup require Node
* A "hacked" font

### JetBrains Mono Nerd font
For MacOS:

* brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
* brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font

## Organization
The configuration is organized into separate files. My previous Neovim configuration was monolithic
and had roughly 1000 lines of code. The Lua-based configuration has nearly 40 files, spread across 8
directoriesâ€”modular rather than monolithic. Currently the configuration totals about 1450 lines of
Lua code, excluding comments and white space.

### Directory Structure
At the root of my Neovim directory is the `init.lua` file. This file has a list of requires that
source the pieces of my configuration. These files are all named spaced under the `lua/usr`
directory to prevent potential collisions with plugins.

    autocmds
    colors
    helpers
    mappings
    options
    plugins


The configuration files for the plugins are all under the `lua/config` directory.

## Plug Ins
These are the core plugins that I have installed.

* [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim "packer") - Plugin management
* [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp "nvim-cmp") - Code completion

based configuration.
